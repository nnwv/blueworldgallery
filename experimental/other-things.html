Intro texts:

Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?‚Äù -Nietzsche, 1882
Spaces are born and die -Pierre Francastel, 1956
All Things Are Delicately Interconnected -Jenny Holzer, 1986
And as for you Bill, when you're on the net, are you lost? or found?
And the rest of us--lost or found--are we on it, or in it? -Allan Sekula, 1999
